# Rock-Paper-Scissors Pseudocode
​
1. Initialize `choices` array: r, p, s. representing rock, paper, or scissors.
​
2. Prompt user to enter "r," "p," or "s".
​
3. Computer chooses a **random** value in a list of "r," "p," or "s."
​
4. We determine if the user wins or not.
​
   * Initialize `wins`, `losses`, `ties` variables to 0
​
   * If user picks rock and if computer picks scissors, then user wins.
​

​
   * If user picks scissors and if computer picks paper, then user wins.
​
   * If user picks paper and if computer picks rock, then user wins.
​
   * If user picks paper and if computer picks scissors, then user loses.
​

​

​
   * If user wins, then we add one to their wins.
